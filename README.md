# Machine Learning Classification Projects (Kaggle)

This repository contains a curated set of applied machine learning classification projects completed using real-world datasets from Kaggle. The projects emphasize end-to-end workflows, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation using domain-appropriate metrics.

---

## Project Overview
Each project addresses a different classification problem while applying a consistent and reproducible machine learning workflow. The goal is to demonstrate breadth across datasets and modeling techniques, as well as sound evaluation practices.

## Included Projects

### 1. Customer Churn Analysis *(Team Project — Team Lead)*
**Notebook:** `customer_churn_classification.ipynb`

Served as team lead for a customer churn classification project focused on identifying at-risk customers using supervised learning methods. Responsibilities included coordinating model development, organizing the evaluation strategy, and guiding metric selection to account for class imbalance.

Models were compared using metrics such as AUC–ROC and precision–recall to reflect business-relevant tradeoffs between false positives and false negatives.

### 2. Breast Cancer Prediction
**Notebook:** `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`

Built and evaluated classification models to distinguish between benign and malignant cases using structured medical data. Emphasis was placed on model interpretability, feature relevance, and precision–recall tradeoffs in a healthcare context.

### 3. Tumor Classification (Benign vs. Malignant)
**Notebook:** `tumor_classification.ipynb`

Applied multiple supervised learning models to a tumor classification dataset, comparing performance across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project focused on balancing predictive performance with robustness across different model choices.

### 4. Forest Cover Type Prediction
**Notebook:** `forest_cover_type_prediction.ipynb`

Developed multi-class classification models to predict forest cover types based on cartographic variables. This project emphasized feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrices for multi-class settings.
