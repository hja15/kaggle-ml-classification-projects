# Machine Learning Classification Projects (Kaggle)

This repository contains a curated set of applied machine learning classification projects completed using real-world datasets from Kaggle. The projects emphasize end-to-end workflows, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation using domain-appropriate metrics.

---

## Project Overview
Each project addresses a different classification problem while applying a consistent and reproducible machine learning workflow. The goal is to demonstrate breadth across datasets and modeling techniques, as well as sound evaluation practices.

## Included Projects

### 1. Customer Churn Analysis *(Team Project, Team Lead)*

Served as team lead for a customer churn classification project focused on identifying at-risk customers using supervised learning methods. Responsibilities included coordinating model development, organizing the evaluation strategy, and guiding metric selection to account for class imbalance and business-relevant tradeoffs.

Models were compared using metrics such as AUC–ROC and precision–recall to balance false positives and false negatives.

### 2. Income Classification

Built classification models to predict income categories based on demographic and employment-related features. The project focused on preprocessing structured tabular data, handling categorical variables, and evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 3. Breast Cancer Tumor Classification (Benign vs. Malignant)

Applied multiple supervised learning models to classify tumors as benign or malignant using medical diagnostic data. Emphasis was placed on selecting appropriate evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and understanding tradeoffs between different model families in a healthcare context.
